		<p>
			I moved to Asheville, NC in 2012 and started to work as a full stack developer 
			to help local small businesses with creating and developing e-commerce that connect them with  customers. 
			Asheville is a beautiful place and located between amazing mountains of Blue Ridge Parkway. 
			Every weekend my family and me take a hike in the mountains to enjoy the beauty of the unique species...

		As a graduate of Computer Science with 5 years programming experience at the United States of America
		working in various web related roles. I have a wide range of skills in a back and front end development.
		I mainly take on back end development projects now, but with experience in these two disciplines I am able to work on projects with the full scope in mind. 
		Employers find this approach to be extremely valuable as I am able to easily integrate with and provide experience and advice on all aspects of a project.
		Some languages I frequently find myself using include PHP, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Ajax, jQuery, HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3 and SQL. 		
		As a E-Commerce developer, I have built numerous online stores over the years. My E-Commerce works that I have built vary from a simple online order forms to stores with thousands of products.
